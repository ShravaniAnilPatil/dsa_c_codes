# Data Structures Implementation in C

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in the C programming language. These programs demonstrate fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and other specific functionalities for each data structure.

---

## Data Structures Included

1. **Array (`array.c`)**
   - Implementation of array-based operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

2. **Queue (`queue.c`)**
   - Standard queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and display.

3. **Circular Queue (`circular_queue.c`)**
   - Circular queue implementation, showcasing efficient utilization of array space.

4. **Stack (`stack.c`)**
   - Stack operations using an array:
     - Push
     - Pop
     - Peek
     - Display

5. **Stack as Linked List (`stack_as_linkedlist.c`)**
   - Stack implementation using a linked list for dynamic memory management.

6. **Singly Linked List (`singly_linkedlist.c`)**
   - Basic singly linked list operations:
     - Insert (at beginning, end, or specific position)
     - Delete
     - Traverse

7. **Circular Singly Linked List (`circular_singlylist.c`)**
   - Circular linked list implementation with operations to traverse and manage the list.

8. **Doubly Linked List (`doubly_linkedlist.c`)**
   - Operations for a doubly linked list:
     - Insert at beginning, end, or specific position
     - Delete from specific positions
     - Reverse the list
     - Traverse in both directions
